    <h1> Teammember1 </h1>

    <p style="color:green;"> I am thinking of creating a website to showcase my love for travel and art. However, I need to figure out how I want the webpage to look and if I am staying in this course. I like the idea of this project more than the bookstore inventory project </p>

    <p> I have traveled to <strong> 10 states </strong> and D.C. Internally, I have traveled to <strong> 6 countries. </strong> </p>

    <p> Below you can find a picture of the hotel I stayed in while in the Dominican Republic. I traveled here in 09/2021.</p>
